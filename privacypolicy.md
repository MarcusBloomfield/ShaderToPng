# Privacy Policy

GLSL Shader to PNG is designed with privacy as a core principle. We achieve this by:
- Processing all data locally in your browser
- Never transmitting your code or images to external servers
- Not using any tracking or analytics tools
- Not requiring any personal information or account creation
- Operating entirely offline after the initial page load

Your privacy is protected because we simply don't collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The application exists solely to provide you with a tool for creating shader art, and it does so while keeping all your data under your complete control.
